<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center; color:green;">SMART IRRIGATION SYSTEM</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify; line-height:30px;">Smart Agriculture is all about saving water,increasing efficiency and reducing the environmental impacts of ornamental plant production practices.Smart agriculture is also  called as Climate-smart agriculture or smart farming.Farmer uses his mobile not only for calling but also for moniter and controlling their agriculture.It is a process of handling and monitering agriculture activity using wireless technology and sensors,by this farmer get real-time information from the field to their remote location.</p>
<p style="font-size:25px; text-align:justify; line-height:30px;">Purpose and Goals of the project:</p>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify; line-height:30px;">The mini project on smart irrigation aims to demonstrate how modern technologies can optimize water usage and promote sustainable agricultural practices. By integrating IoT sensors, controllers, and data analytics, the project will showcase an automated system that monitors soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health to make informed irrigation decisions. This hands-on learning experience will provide practical skills in building and programming smart systems while highlighting the benefits of water conservation and cost efficiency. The project also aims to create a scalable and replicable prototype, encouraging broader adoption of smart irrigation methods. Through this initiative, participants will gain insights into sustainable resource management and the technological advancements driving precision agriculture, ultimately contributing to environmental sustainability and operational cost savings.</p>
